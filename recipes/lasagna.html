        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A quick and easy beef lasagne that's extra cheesy and ready to eat in just 1 hour! And best of all, a time saver, as there's absolutely no need to make a bechamel sauce! The perfect midweek family dinner.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>onion & garlic - use a finely diced brown (or yellow) onion. You can use either store-bought minced garlic or mince your own garlic cloves.</li>
            <li>beef mince - also referred to as ground beef or ground beef mince.</li>
            <li>tomato paste - this gives the sauce a rich flavour.</li>
            <li>tinned tomatoes - choose diced or crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li>beef stock - use a liquid beef stock or make your own by mixing 1 teaspoon of beef stock powder through every 1 cup of water.</li>
            <li>dried italian herbs - I like to use parsley and oregano.</li>
            <li>cheeses - mozzarella is the secret to this oozy, cheesy beef lasagne! Grated parmesan on top also gives that lovely special flavour hit that you just have to have with a pasta dish!</li>
            <li>lasagne sheets - I like to use fresh lasagne sheets rather than dried lasagne sheets as they cook much quicker and stay softer and more moist.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>SAUTÉ - Add the diced onion and minced garlic to a large frying pan. Sauté the onion and garlic until soft and translucent.</li>
            <li>ADD THE BEEF - Add the beef mince, breaking up the clumps with a spoon. Cook until the mince is browned.</li>
            <li>COOK THE SAUCE - Add the tomato paste, tomatoes, beef stock, Italian herbs and salt and pepper. Bring to a boil and then simmer (stirring occasionally) for 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>ASSEMBLE - 
                <p>Assemble the lasagne by adding a layer of sauce to the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Top with fresh lasagne sheets and then shredded mozzarella cheese.</p> 
                <p>Repeat the layers until you have used all of the sauce and lasagne sheets. Finish with a layer of mozzarella cheese and add a sprinkle of grated parmesan over the top.</p>
            </li>
            <li>BAKE - Bake in a preheated oven for 30-40 minutes or until cooked through and the cheese has melted and turned golden on top. Tip: If you notice the cheese over-browning too much, add a loose sheet of foil over the top or move to a lower shelf in the oven.</li>
        </ol>
